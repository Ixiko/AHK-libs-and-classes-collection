# Faster hotstring

## Features

The script snippets implements a faster "hotstring" which use clipboard pasting rather than inputting letter-by-letter as in official implentation of Autohotkey while preserving the "case-conforming" feature of official implementation. i.e if you type first letter in caps, the first letter of the replacement will be capitalized (if it's a letter), if you type every letter in caps, all letter of the replacement will be capitalized.

## How to use

see demo.ahk, should be obvious.
