class particles

Properites:
	assuming you used: psys:=new particles(30)
	psys.emitters[emitterN].property
	| get/set the properties as mentioned in addEmitter()
	
	psys.particles[emitterN, particleN].property
	| Available properties to get/set:
	| x1     = center x point for a line/circle/everything
	| y1     = center y point for a line/circle/everything
	| x2     = for lines, the second x point to connect to
	| y2     = for lines, the second y point to connect to
	| dir    = what way is it facing
	| vel    = how much gravity (velocity) is affecting it
	| radius = size of a circle, font size of text or the scale of an image
	| lineW  = How fat a line is
	| life   = current life phase
	| mlife  = how much life did it have on creation
	| color  = what beautiful color will it be
	| alpha  = how see-through is it? 255 is solid, 0 is invisible
	| type   = how is it going to be displayed, this is the particle type name
	
	psys.fps
	| the simulations FPS.
	| !!! Note !!! Changing this does NOT affect psys.delay (but it probably should)
	
	psys.delay
	| How fast the simulation should update, based on the FPS.
	| This is not used internally, it's meant to be used for the user within sleep/settimer.
	
	psys.drawCount
	| How many things are currently drawn on screen
	
	psys.defaults
	| get/set the default values, as mentioned in addEmitter()



Methods:
	__New(FPS=30)
	| Create a particle system that'll hold all the emitter(s) and particle info.
	| EXAMPLE: var:=new particles(24) ; create a new particle system that runs at 24 fps
	| EXAMPLE: psys:=new particles(30) ; create a new particle system that runs at 30 fps
	
	setCanvas(cx, cy, cw, ch, cquality, drawOnThis="")
	| This is what particles get drawn onto.
	| cx = Canvas x position on the screen
	| cy = Canvas y position on the screen
	| cw = Canvas width
	| ch = Canvas height
	| cquality = Canvas quality. values are 0-4. Default = 0, HighSpeed = 1, HighQuality = 2, None = 3, AntiAlias = 4
	| drawOnThis = If specified, it draws onto a control (see "demo2_Draw_on_GUI.ahk") otherwise it draws over the screen.
	| if drawOnThis is **NOT** blank, cx/y/w/h will be set to the x/y/w/h of the control used, so you may specify 0 for them all.
	| EXAMPLE: psys.setCanvas(0,0,0,0, 4, hwnd)
	| EXAMPLE: psys.setCanvas(0, 0, A_ScreenHeight, A_ScreenWidth, 2)

	clear()
	| clear everything that has been drawn, so you can display the next frame
	| EXAMPLE: psys.clear()

	step()
	| Advance the simulation forward 1 tick, but doesn't draw anything.
	| EXAMPLE: psys.step()
	
	draw(drawOnThis="")
	| Goes through every emitter and particle in the particle system and draws them onto the screen/control
	| drawOnThis = If specified, it draws onto a control (see "demo2_Draw_on_GUI.ahk") otherwise it draws over the screen.
	| !!! IMPORTANT NOTE !!!
	| - Some emitter types, as of (Tue January 03, 2017) only work with certain modes.
	| - These work on both drawOnThis modes: Generic, Generic Fill, Sparks, AllLines
	| - These *only* work when drawOnThis is specified: Cursor
	| - These *only* work when drawOnThis is NOT specified: Text, Image
	|
	| Returns the Graphics that it was drawn onto
	|
	| EXAMPLE: psys.draw()
	| EXAMPLE: psys.draw(hwnd)
	
	addEmitter(pe="")
	| Create a new emitter and give it all its properties.
	| pe = If pe (particle emitter) is blank, it uses all the default values.
	| Default values ("option":default):
	| "type":"Generic"  = How it'll behave and be displayed.
	|                     Avalable types: 
	|                     - Generic      = Creates connected lines and.or dots.
	|                     - Generic Fill = Creates connected lines and.or dots, but all particles are connected by polygon.
	|                     - Sparks       = Creates jitter squares
	|                     - AllLines     = Same as Generic except there are lines that connect every particle to every other particle
	|                     - Text         = Particles, with words*. It also uses a hardcoded font everyone loves, Comic Sans MS.
	|                     - Image        = Particles, with images*
	|                     - Cursor       = Particles, using you current cursor*
	|                     * !!! these do not work 100% correct, use with caution
	| "life":[1]        = An array of 2-3 values of how long it should live. [1] is 1 second, [0.5,2] is 0.5-2 seconds, at random.

	|                     If [type] is "image", you may place your image(s) here instead of colors. ["c:\path\img1.jpg","c:\path\img2.png","c:\path\img3.jpg"]
	| "colorMode":1     = How the colors should be chosen. 
	|                     Available modes:

	|                     2 = Choose randomly,
	|                     3 = Base the color on how old it is,
	|                     4 = Same as 3, but reversed
	| "colorVari":0     = Apply some random color variations. -255 - 255. 0 is none.
	| "alpha":[255]     = An array of transparency values to smoothly transition between over its life. 255 is solid, 0 is invisible.
	| "lineWidth":[0]   = How thick, in pixels, should lines be? and array of values to smoothly transition between over its life.
	| "circleSize":[10] = The radius of circles. an array of values to smoothly transition between over its life.
	|                     When [Type] is "text", this is the font size.
	|                     When [Type] is "image", this is the scale of the image ("100" being real size, "10" is 10%)
	| "pattern":["r"]   = An array of angles, in degrees, choose between at random.
	|                     "r" may be used anywhere for a random direction (0-360).
	|                     values may be negative. 
	|                     if the first field contains "c", it cycles the directions in order.
	|                     if the first field contains "m", the angles are offset based on the direction the mouse is going
	|                     if the first field contains "w", same as "m", but reversed
	| "speed":[100]     = How fast should stuff move in the current direction, in pixels-per-second. an array of values to smoothly transition between over its life.

	| EXAMPLES:
	| ------
	| - ; 1) Use all the default values
	| - psys.addEmitter()
	| ------
	| - ; 2) save the emitter to a variable "e1" then modify the values.
	| - e1:=psys.addEmitter()
	| - e1.life:=[1,2]
	| - e1.speed:=[100,500,0,0]
	| - e1.pattern:=["c", 90, 210, 330]
	| ------
	| - ; 3) same as 2, but using the built-in functions to set the values
	| - psys.addEmitter()
	| - psys.life([1,2], 2)
	| - psys.speed([100,500,0,0], 2)
	| - psys.pattern(["c", 90, 210, 330], 2)
	| ------
	| - ; 3) same as 2, but using the short version of setting the values
	| - e1:=psys.addEmitter({"type":"AllLines", "life":[1], "color":["dd3333"], "alpha":[80], "lineWidth":[2,1], "circleSize":[5], "gravity":[50], "spiral":[180]})
	
	addParticle(px, py, pe=1, misc*)
	| Adds a new particle to the simulation. AHK seems to handle around 50-100 (based on system) at any given time pretty smoothly.
	| px = The particle x coordinate. the emitter's offx will affect this.
	| py = The particle y coordinate. the emitter's offy will affect this.
	| pe = What emitter to use
	| misc* = Additional parameters for emitter types such as "text" and "Image".dditional options (currently not fully functional)
	|         for Images: specify the path
	|         EXAMPLE: psys.addParticle(20, 100, 1, "Text particles!")
	|         EXAMPLE: psys.addParticle(200, 200, 2, "c:\path\to\image.png")
	| EXAMPLE: psys.addParticle(100, 100, 1)


All of these use the same rules as addEmitter, except they are function-form.

	| life(plife, eNum=1)
	| offx(poffx, eNum=1)
	| offy(poffy, eNum=1)
