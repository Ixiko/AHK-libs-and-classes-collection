# eval() - AHK v2

eval() func for strings of mathematical expressions in AHK v2.

## Highlights

* Parses text strings in AHK v2 syntax.
* All AHK operators are now parsed and solved.  (If I missed some please let me know.)
* No Math() functions are accepted currently, this is however planned to be implemented.
* An example of how to implement this can be found in [C++ Constants Scanner/Database](https://github.com/TheArkive/Win32-API-Const).  All of the calculations for the constants are parsed using eval().
