# VerCompare.ahk
**VerCompare()** function for **AutoHotkey v1.1** - Compare two semantic version strings similar like the function in v2 of AutoHotkey! For more information see: https://lexikos.github.io/v2/docs/commands/VerCompare.htm
## Why?
Using the operators in AutoHotkey to check if two different version strings are either higher or lower, does seem to give inaccurate results and I heard that v2 exclusively got a function for that. Since this doesn't exist in v1.1, I wanted to have something that hopefully behaves like the v2 function.
## Tipp
You can put **`VerCompare.ahk`** into your **[Lib folder](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Functions.htm#lib)** and access the function without needing to use **`#Include VerCompare.ahk`** in your script!
## Requires testing!
The library itself **hasn't been tested yet** because I currently don't have any machine to test AutoHotkey code.
