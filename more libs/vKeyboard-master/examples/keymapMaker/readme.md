Hey, thanks for trying the ``vKeyboard`` library!

By means of this GUI, you can the WYSIWYG-way create keyboard layouts, export and save them as Layout JSON representations, compatible with the [setHotkeys interface method](https://github.com/A-AhkUser/vKeyboard#setlayout).
Usage:
- Use the arrow keys to navigate through keyboard's keys.
- Long-click on a key to display an UI dialog; it allows you to customize the behaviour of the key.
- Click on a key to display in an info tip its current descriptor features.
- ALT+m > push a column of keys
- CTRL+ALT+m > pop a column of keys
- ALT+n > push a row of keys
- CTRL+ALT+n >  pop a row of keys
- NumpadAdd > append a layer
- Delete > delete the current layer
- CTRL+L > load your keyboard layout mapping
- CTRL+S > export and save the mapping of your keyboard layout
- CTRL+Tab > cycle through layers

> The coordinates (z-layer, y-row, x-key) of the key currently focused appear on the window title bar.

Cheers
