In this folder you will find some commented examples illustrating the use and some of the possibilities of the script.
- sample_example
> *As its name suggests, a basic example.*
- test
> *A simple showcase script. You can test most of the properties and methods provided by the script using hotkeys.*
- fenchai_example
> *Sample example demonstrating how a custom event handling can be designed to navigate the web via an instance of ``vKeyboard`` and by means of user-defined prefixes, on the model of the [Universal_Searcher by fenchai](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=42788&p=194488).*
- example_defaultCb
> *This example shows how to use a custom default callback - which will be executed in place of the built-in default callback each time a key on the visual keyboard is pressed/clicked (assuming that a f-function has not been set for the given key).*
- example_Windows
> *A script that allows, using only a joystick, to navigate the desktop, your browser, your applications etc. while at the same time giving the possibility
to invoke the visual keyboard when it comes to type and enter text. The script focuses on reading and is designed to read on Foxit Reader - but you can modify double-colon hotkeys at the bottom of the script to make it fit your needs.*
- keymapMaker
> *An instance of ``vKeyboard`` designed in such a way that it creates its own keyboard layouts! This way, you can the WYSIWYG-way create or modify, export and save keyboard layouts.*
