	Title:	_Forms

 Group: Overview

		Forms framework is a group of modules used together to create rich AHK & AHK_L applications and graphical user interfaces.
		It contains the list of optional module includes with each module designed to work with or *without* the framework in place.
		It includes number of custom controls, extensions and useful libraries. <Form> module is a backbone of the framework.
		
 Group: Features

		All modules are developed so they fulfill specific goals :

		o Standalone. All modules are independent of each other unless stated differently. You can copy any module to your script and use it without other modules.
		  They generally don't depend on your script settings.
		o Standardized. Generally, modules use the same or similar APIs whenever possible. Functions with big number of parameters use
		  named arguments to avoid long list of empty parameters. Functions doing similar things are declared the same and arguments
		  having similar purpose are named equally cross-module.
		o Clean. They don't create any globals and try not to influence the hosting script in any way unless specified differently.
		o Documented. All scripts contain documentation in the source code. You can use mkdoc script to create HTML documentation out of it by simply
		  running it in the folder with scripts. You can use comment remover to reduce the size of the modules. You can also merge them into
		  single include using ScriptMerge, which gives you the option to keep the framework and its documentation in single file.
		o Free. All modules are open source and free.


 Group: How to Use

		If framework is located in "\inc" folder its enough to add the following line at the end of your script :

		>#include inc
		>#include _Forms.ahk

		After that you can use any of the Forms modules. You might need to specify
		>SetWorkingDir inc

		before calling modules that use 3thd party dll's. This is not mandatory since Add function for such modules always 
		have DllPath parameter.

		After the development is complete, you can *delete* all modules you didn't use except _Forms.ahk which is used to #include
		modules you didn't delete.

		Optionally, you can pack your script and modules you used into the single file using ScriptMerge (if you want to distribute 
		your script as single ahk file).

 Group: Known bugs/issues
		o Modules use decimal format of integer (default one). Module may not work as expected if 
		integer format is changed to Hex as it doesn't set and restore integer 
		format for practical reasons (it would have to be repeated on far too many places).
		If you set different integer format restore it back to default one once you are finished.
