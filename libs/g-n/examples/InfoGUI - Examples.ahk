    John F. Kennedy
    `nInaugural Address
    `nDelivered January 20, 1961
    `n`nVice President Johnson, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, President
    Eisenhower, Vice President Nixon, President Truman, reverend clergy, fellow
    citizens:
    `n`nWe observe today not a victory of party, but a celebration of freedom --
    symbolizing an end, as well as a beginning -- signifying renewal, as well as
    change. For I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath
    our forebears prescribed nearly a century and three-quarters ago.
    `n`nThe world is very different now. For man holds in his mortal hands the
    power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life. And
    yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still
    at issue around the globe -- the belief that the rights of man come not from
    the generosity of the state, but from the hand of God.
    `n`nWe dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution.
    Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike,
    that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans -- born in
    this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud
    of our ancient heritage, and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing
    of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to
    which we are committed today at home and around the world.
    `n`nLet every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall
    pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend,
    oppose any foe, to assure the survival and the success of liberty.
    `n`nThis much we pledge -- and more.
    `n`nTo those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share, we
    pledge the loyalty of faithful friends. United there is little we cannot do
    in a host of cooperative ventures. Divided there is little we can do -- for
    we dare not meet a powerful challenge at odds and split asunder.
    `n`nTo those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free, we pledge
    our word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away merely
    to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny. We shall not always expect to
    find them supporting our view. But we shall always hope to find them
    strongly supporting their own freedom -- and to remember that, in the past,
    those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up
    inside.
    `n`nTo those people in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling to
    break the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our best efforts to help them help
    themselves, for whatever period is required -- not because the Communists
    may be doing it, not because we seek their votes, but because it is right.
    If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few
    who are rich.
    `n`nTo our sister republics south of our border, we offer a special pledge:
    to convert our good words into good deeds, in a new alliance for progress,
    to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of
    poverty. But this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey of
    hostile powers. Let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them to
    oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the Americas. And let every
    other power know that this hemisphere intends to remain the master of its
    own house.
    `n`nTo that world assembly of sovereign states, the United Nations, our last
    best hope in an age where the instruments of war have far outpaced the
    instruments of peace, we renew our pledge of support -- to prevent it from
    becoming merely a forum for invective, to strengthen its shield of the new
    and the weak, and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run.
    `n`nFinally, to those nations who would make themselves our adversary, we
    offer not a pledge but a request: that both sides begin anew the quest for
    peace, before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science engulf all
    humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction.
    `n`nWe dare not tempt them with weakness. For only when our arms are
    sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never
    be employed.
    `n`nBut neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort
    from our present course -- both sides overburdened by the cost of modern
    weapons, both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet
    both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of
    mankind's final war.
    `n`nSo let us begin anew -- remembering on both sides that civility is not a
    sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof. Let us never
    negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.
    `n`nLet both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring
    those problems which divide us.
    `n`nLet both sides, for the first time, formulate serious and precise
    proposals for the inspection and control of arms, and bring the absolute
    power to destroy other nations under the absolute control of all nations.
    `n`nLet both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its
    terrors. Together let us explore the stars, conquer the deserts, eradicate
    disease, tap the ocean depths, and encourage the arts and commerce.
    `n`nLet both sides unite to heed, in all corners of the earth, the command
    of Isaiah -- to "undo the heavy burdens, and [to] let the oppressed go
    free."¹
    `n`nAnd, if a beachhead of cooperation may push back the jungle of
    suspicion, let both sides join in creating a new endeavor -- not a new
    balance of power, but a new world of law -- where the strong are just, and
    the weak secure, and the peace preserved.
    `n`nAll this will not be finished in the first one hundred days. Nor will it
    be finished in the first one thousand days; nor in the life of this
    Administration; nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. But let us
    begin.
    `n`nIn your hands, my fellow citizens, more than mine, will rest the final
    success or failure of our course. Since this country was founded, each
    generation of Americans has been summoned to give testimony to its national
    loyalty. The graves of young Americans who answered the call to service
    surround the globe.
    `n`nNow the trumpet summons us again -- not as a call to bear arms, though
    arms we need -- not as a call to battle, though embattled we are -- but a
    call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out,
    "rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation,"² a struggle against the common
    enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself.
    `n`nCan we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance, North
    and South, East and West, that can assure a more fruitful life for all
    mankind? Will you join in that historic effort?
    `n`nIn the long history of the world, only a few generations have been
    granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger. I do
    not shrink from this responsibility -- I welcome it. I do not believe that
    any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other
    generation. The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this
    endeavor will light our country and all who serve it. And the glow from that
    fire can truly light the world.
    `n`nAnd so, my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you;
    ask what you can do for your country.
    `n`nMy fellow citizens of the world, ask not what America will do for you,
    but what together we can do for the freedom of man.
    `n`nFinally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world,
    ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we
    ask of you. With a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the
    final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking
    His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on earth God's work must
    truly be our own.
