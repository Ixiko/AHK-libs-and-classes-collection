About: Introduction

    Any parameter enclosed between '[' and ']' are optional.

    Mount([SourcePath], [Mountpoint], [Options])
        Returns on success mounted drive with ending backslash and on failure
        a string without content.
        
        If Mountpoint is not given, then it looks for first free drive otherwise
        existing SourcePath will be mounted to given Mountpoint. If SourcePath
        is not given, it defaults to WorkingDir.
        
        The SourcePath can contain wildcards ("*" and "?") and the relative
        directory dots ("." for current dir and ".." for one up dir).
        
        Any existing Mountpoint will be updated (first umount the old one, and
        then remounting the new one).
                
        Currently there is only one option used to unmount the drive.
        
    Mount_UnMount([Mountpoint], [Options])
        Like Mount(), but without the need of SourcePath. Also the unmount
        option is here given over to Mount() always.
    
    Mount_GetMount([Path])
        If the specified Path is a drive, the full real path is returned. If
        the Path is not given, first virtual drive will be get.
    
    Mount_GetMountPathes([Variable])
        It gets all virtual drives and paths. The Variable will hold a list in
        following format: Drive . ">" . Path . "`n"
        The return contains the number of all virtual drives.

About: Examples

    Example 1
        > Mount()
    -> F:
    Calling Mount() without any parameter mounts current WorkingDir to first
    found free drive letter and returns it.
        
    Example 2
        > FileSelectFolder, SourcePath, ::{20d04fe0-3aea-1069-a2d8-08002b30309d}, 3, Select folder to mount
        > Mount(SourcePath, "x")
    -> X:
    Here SourcePath will be mounted to drive letter X, if it`s free. If the
    drive letter is not free and if its a virtual drive letter, then the drive
    (here "X:") will be unmounted and SourcePath will be mounted as the new one.
    
    Example 3
        > Mount_UnMount()
    -> X:
    Calling Mount_UnMount() without any parameter unmounts the first founded virtual
    drive, mapped with Mount(). It returns the founded drive path (here "X:\").
    
    Example 4
        > MsgBox % Mount_GetMount()
    -> X:
    Calling Mount_GetMount() without any parameter gets the drive letter of first
    virtual drive letter (without backslash). But this slow.
        
    Example 5
        > MsgBox % Mount_GetMount("x")
    -> D:\files\subdirectory
    Calling Mount_GetMount() with drive letter returns the real full path of mapped
    virtual drive (without backslash). But if the given drive letter does not
    exist or isn`t a mounted drive, then a void string is returned.
    
    Example 6
        > Mount_GetMountPathes()
    -> 2
    Calling Mount_GetMountPathes() will get number of mounted pathes and a string with
    all founded virtual drives.
