Otherwise, these values are set to 0.</p><div class="CHeading">Exchangeable Image File (EXIF)</div><p>The Exchangeable Image File (EXIF) is not an image format.&nbsp; It is a standard for embedding technical metadata in image files that many camera manufacturers use and many image-processing programs support.&nbsp; EXIF metadata can be embedded in JPEG and TIFF images.</p><p>At this writing, this function does not read EXIF data in order to get the image width and height values.&nbsp; Most JPEG files store image width and height values within specific Start of Frame tags.&nbsp; See the JPEG section below for more information.</p><p>There are a very small number of JPEG image files that do not have Start of Frame tags but may have EXIF data.&nbsp; For now, the function will return 0 for the width, height, and bits per pixel values when these files are processed.&nbsp; The function may be modified in the future to look for image width and height values from within the EXIF data in the few files with condition.</p><p>There are a small number of JPEG image files that do not have Start of Frame tags or EXIF data.&nbsp; This function will return 0 for the width, height and bits per pixel values when these files are processed.&nbsp; Other image programs are able to identify the image width and height for these files but it likely that that entire image must be loaded in order to determine the image width, height, and bits per pixel.&nbsp; For now, this function will not load the entire image in order to determine with image width and height but that may change in the future.</p><div class="CHeading">GIF</div><p>For GIF files, the value returned for the Bits Per Pixel value (the r_bpp output variable and the bpp property on the return object) is collected from a 3-bit color resolution field from the Logical Screen Descriptor section of the file.&nbsp; According to the GIF89a Specification document, &quot;This value represents the size of the entire palette from which the colors in the graphic were selected, not the number of colors actually used in the graphic.&quot;&nbsp; In addition, this value does not affect the way the images are decoded and so the value can be manually changed by the author or anybody for that matter.</p><p>Observation: The Bits Per Pixel value returned by this function for GIF files is often correct but the developer should not depend on the accuracy of the data for this image type.</p><div class="CHeading">Icons and Cursors</div><p>Icon files (.ico) can contain multiple icons with different icon sizes and different image qualities.&nbsp; In addition, icons can be any size but the file format only allocates 1 byte of space per dimension to identify the size so the maximum size is 255x255.&nbsp; 0x0 usually indicates a 256x256 icon but it could be any size over 255x255.&nbsp; To resolve these issues, this function uses the following approach.</p><p>If the icon file only has one icon, the size of the only icon is returned.&nbsp; Otherwise, the function uses the <b>LoadImage</b> system function to identity and load the default icon and then return the size of that icon.&nbsp; LoadImage is used because it is fast and it uses a consistent method for determining which icon is the default icon.&nbsp; This approach is a bit slower than other image types but icon files are relatively small so the time it takes to load and evaluate an icon from an icon file is relatively fast.</p><p>Standard cursors files (.cur) are similar to icon files in that they can contain multiple cursors with different sizes.&nbsp; However, most cursor files contain one or two cursors and the quality of the images are usually the same.&nbsp; The <b>LoadImage</b> system function always returns the first cursor in the file when no size is specified.&nbsp; This function uses the same approach and returns the size of the first cursor in the file.</p><p>Animated cursor files (.ani) contain many images but the size of the images are all the same.&nbsp; The size of the first image in the file is returned.</p><div class="CHeading">Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG)</div><p>The Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) image format is not the oldest image format but it is probably the most popular, at least for now.&nbsp; The first version of the JPEG format was released in 1992, the latest version in 1994.&nbsp; The JPEG format supports a large number of encoding formats.&nbsp; Because of it's popularity, finding JPEG samples is very easy but finding samples that use the more obscure encoding formats can be very difficult if not impossible.&nbsp; Some of the early encoding formats were abandoned in lieu of newer/better encoding formats.</p><p>This function supports JPEG image files with Start of Frame 0 (0xFFC0), 1 (0xFFC1), and 2 (0xFFC2) tags.&nbsp; The function includes code for a few other tags but they have never been tested because no samples with these tags have been found.&nbsp; If the JPEG file does not contain any of these tags, the width, height, and bits per pixel fields will be set to 0.</p><p>There are a few files out there that have no Start of Frame tags at all.&nbsp; They do have an Application Segment 0 (0xE0) tag but no Start of Frame flags.&nbsp; Some image programs will decode application segment flags but technically, these are &quot;application&quot; specific so those programs include extra code to figure out which application program was used to populate the tag and then extract the information from that.&nbsp; At this time, this function does not try to decode Application Segment tags.&nbsp; That may change in the future.</p><div class="CHeading">PBM, PGM, and PPM</div><p>The value returned for the r_bpp output variable and the bpp property on the return object depends on the file type.</p><p>For Portable Bitmap Format (PBM) files, the bits per pixel value is always 1 since all PBM images are monochrome.</p><p>For Portable Graymap Format (PGM) and Portable Pixmap Format (PPM) files, the bits per pixel value is calculated based on the MaxValue field which for PGM files is the maximum gray value (usually 255) and for PPM files is the maximum color value (usually 255).</p><p>Please note that the calculated bits per pixel value is not necessarily the actual amount of space used on the file to represent each pixel.&nbsp; The monochrome, grayscale, or color values can be stored as ASCII characters, so the actual amount of space used on the files can be much larger than in the binary version of files.</p><div class="CHeading">Supported Image Formats</div><p>The following image formats are supported: Animated Cursor (ANI), Bitmap (BMP), Standard Cursor (CUR), Exchangeable Image File (Exif), Graphics Interchange Format (GIF), Icon (ICO), Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG), Portable Network Graphics (PNG), and Tag Image File Format (TIFF).&nbsp; &quot;Supported&quot; means that most of the documented formats for these image types are supported.&nbsp; There are several old or deprecated formats from these image types that were purposely excluded.&nbsp; In most cases, these old formats are not supported by GDI+ and other image programs.</p><p>The following formats are partially supported: Windows Metafile (WMF), and Enhanced MetaFile (EMF).&nbsp; See the <b>WMF and EMF</b> section for more information.</p><div class="CHeading">Supported Image Formats, Part 2</div><p>The image formats included in this section are not supported by AutoHotkey which includes AutoHotkey GUIs, the LoadPicture function, the IL_Add function, etc.</p><p>The following image formats are supported: JPEG extended range (JPEG XR, little-endian only), PiCture eXchange (PCX), Portable Bitmap Format (PBM), Portable Graymap Format (PGM), Portable Pixmap Format (PPM), and WebP (VP8, VP8L, and VP8X). &quot;Supported&quot; means that most of the documented formats for these image types are supported.&nbsp; There may be old or deprecated formats from these image types that were purposely excluded.&nbsp; In most cases, these old formats are not supported by other image programs.</p><p>Preliminary support has been added for the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format.&nbsp; Please note that many SVG files don't have &quot;Width&quot; and &quot;Height&quot; tags.&nbsp; The rendering engine will fill the space allocated to the image.&nbsp; In these cases, 0 is returned for the width and height.&nbsp; Additional testing is needed.</p><div class="CHeading">WMF and EMF</div><p>This function provides limited support for Windows Metafile (WMF), and Enhanced MetaFile (EMF).&nbsp; Although the most common formats for these image types are supported, not all formats are supported yet.&nbsp; Since the size of the image from these image types is calculated and can vary depending on the current DPI, the values returned by this function may not be exactly the same as what is returned by other programs in all cases.</p><p>For most WMF files, the return values are usually an exact match to other programs but for a few files, the width and/or height (usually not both) might be 1 pixel larger than from other programs.</p><p>Please note that the original/official WMF file format is not supported by this function.&nbsp; The original file format does not include size information in the header so it is useless to this function.&nbsp; The WMF format supported by this function is known as Placeable Metafile and was created by Aldus Corporation as a non-standard way of specifying how a metafile is mapped and scaled on an output device.&nbsp; Although this format is not officially supported by Windows, it is widely used and some Windows programs, specifically GDI+, support this format.</p><p>For EMF files, 1 pixel is added to each dimension (width and height) so that the return value will match the size returned from GDI+.&nbsp; This adjustment will ensure that the size matches the value returned from the AutoHotkey LoadPicture command which uses GDI+ for EMF files.&nbsp; Other image programs (Ex: IrfanView) may show a size that is 1 pixel less for the width and height.</p><p>Although use of WMF and EMF files has waned sharply since they were introduced by Microsoft in the 1990s, they are still in use by various programs.&nbsp; Support for these formats was specifically included in this function because they are still supported by GDI+ which is used by AutoHotkey.</p><p>The observations and adjustments in this section are based on <u>very</u> limited data.&nbsp; Real world testing may return different results and additional adjustments may be needed.</p><div class="CHeading">Remarks</div><p>This function identifies and returns the dimensions (width and height) of a image from a stand-alone image file (Ex: MyPhoto.jpg) without loading the image into memory.</p><p>The contents of the file determines the image type, not the file's extension.&nbsp; For example, JPEG files are usually stored in 6 standard file extensions (.jpg, .jpeg, .jif, etc.) but can also be stored in a non-standard file extension (Ex: .MyPic)&nbsp; This function will recognize the image format regardless of the file extension.&nbsp; If unsure, give it a try/see.</p><p>Please note that although a considerable amount of time and effort has been spend developing and testing this function, the testing has been limited to the images files that were available and to a select number of files that were downloaded from the internet.&nbsp; Because is impossible to test all situations, it is likely that a few issues will pop up after this library is released.&nbsp; If you find a problem, please report it.</p><div class="CHeading">Performance Observations</div><p>This function was written to get the size of images stored in stand-alone files without loading the entire image into memory.&nbsp; In theory, this function should be much faster than loading the image because 1) only a small portion of the file is read, 2) there is no need to decompress the image (GIF, TIF, etc.) or render the image (EMF, WMF, etc.)</p><p>File system requests for files on standard hardware (i.e. hard drives) have always been the primary speed bottleneck for most computer operations.&nbsp; The performance of this function depends on whether the image file has been loaded to the system cache or not.</p><p>If the image file has not been loaded to the system cache, performance varies depending on the size of the image.&nbsp; For small images, this function does not offer much of a performance improvement over loading the image from the file and then determining the size of the image.&nbsp; For larger image files, the performance gap is wider but not as much as you would think.&nbsp; For very large image files or if the image is compressed, this function is significantly faster than loading the entire image.</p><p>If the image file has been loaded to the system cache, the performance improvement can be very significant, even for small images.&nbsp; In these cases, this function can be anywhere from 2 to 40 times faster (or more) than loading the entire image.&nbsp; For compressed images or images that must be rendered, this function can be more than 50 times faster in some cases.&nbsp; Your results will vary.</p></div>
