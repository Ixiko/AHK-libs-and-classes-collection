; BASIC EXAMPLES:
SoundSet, 50  ; Set the master volume to 50%
SoundSet +10  ; Increase master volume by 10%
SoundSet -10  ; Decrease master volume by 10%
SoundSet, 1, Microphone, mute  ; mute the microphone
SoundSet, +1, , mute  ; Toggle the master mute (set it to the opposite state)
SoundSet, +20, Master, bass  ; Increase bass level by 20%.
if ErrorLevel
    MsgBox, The BASS setting is not supported for MASTER.


; SOUNDCARD ANALYSIS
; Use the following script to discover your soundcard's capabilities (component types and control types).
; It displays the results in a simple ListView.

; The numbers correspond to the following items (in order): CUSTOM, BOOLEANMETER, SIGNEDMETER, PEAKMETER,

; MULTIPLESELECT, MIXER, MICROTIME, MILLITIME
